NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ReportPhase - Report whats going on.

VERSION
    version 0.00

SYNOPSIS
    In your dist.ini:

      [ReportPhase / Phase_Begins]

      ...

      [ReportPhase / Phase_Ends]

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin was written to give the author some idea of the order that
    various roles are invoked under different conditions. So, ReportPhase
    implements every major role, and reports when it is being invoked. For
    best results it should be used as both the very first, and the very last
    plugin listed in dist.ini, as it will then report entering and exiting
    every phase.

    Other than this phase reporting, this plugin has no use.

ATTRIBUTES
    NONE
